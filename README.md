# IRIS-DATASET-VISUALIZATION (Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
**Overview**  
  This project provides a comprehensive visualization of the IRIS dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The dataset consists of three different species of the Iris flower, with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to help beginners understand data visualization techniques and the insights that can be gained from graphical representations of data.  
  
**Features**  

--Bar Plot: Displays the frequency distribution of different Iris species in the dataset.  
--Joint Plot: Shows the relationship between two numerical features along with their individual distributions.  
--FacetGrid Plot: Helps visualize relationships across multiple subsets of data based on species.  
--Box Plot (Whisker Plot): Provides a statistical summary of data distribution, highlighting median, quartiles, and outliers.  
--Strip Plot: A scatter-based visualization that displays individual data points while showing the distribution of values.  
--Violin Plot: Combines box plots and density plots to represent the probability distribution of numerical data.  
--Pair Plot: Displays scatter plots for all feature pair combinations, allowing quick visualization of relationships.  
--Heatmap: Highlights correlations between different features, helping identify strongly related variables.  
--Swarm Plot: Similar to a strip plot but prevents overlapping of points by adjusting their positions.  
--LM Plot: Displays linear relationships between variables.  
--Factor Plot: A higher-level categorical plot used for visualization across different categories.  
--KDE Plot: Shows the probability density distribution of features for a given species.  
--Dashboard: Combines multiple plots into a single visualization layout for better analysis.  
--Stacked Histogram: Depicts the distribution of numerical values across different species.  
--Area Plot: Provides a visual representation of multiple numerical features over the dataset.  
--Distribution Plot: Shows how a single numerical feature is distributed across different values.  

**Objective**  
  This project is designed for data enthusiasts who want to explore and understand various data visualization techniques. By using different types of plots, we can gain meaningful insights into the structure and relationships of the Iris dataset.  

**Contribution**  
  This is an ongoing project, and more visualizations and improvements will be added over time. If you find this work useful, feel free to contribute or provide feedback.
